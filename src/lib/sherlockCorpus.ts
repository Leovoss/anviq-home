  { id: "automation", prompts: ["automation", "automate workflow", "can you automate our manual process", "replace manual work", "spreadsheet"], answer: "Automation is useful when it removes a real handoff or repeated task without hiding the decision boundary. If a spreadsheet is carrying operational responsibility, it deserves a closer look.", route: "/explore/services" },
  { id: "infrastructure", prompts: ["infrastructure", "servers", "deployment", "cloud"], answer: "Infrastructure is part of delivery: agreed hosting, access controls, deployment, and documentation.

  { id: "facts", prompts: ["do you know everything", "are you smart", "how intelligent are you", "can you answer anything", "are you clever"], answer: "Only the questions within my case file. Knowing the boundary is generally a better sign of intelligence than pretending it is not there." },
  { id: "help", prompts: ["help", "what can i ask", "what do you know", "suggest questions"], answer: "Try: “What does Anviq do?”, “How much does it cost?”, “Tell me about Anviq Agents”, or “How do we start?”" },
  { id: "compliment", prompts: ["nice site", "great design", "looks good", "love this"], answer: "Noted. The interface will attempt not to become insufferable about it." },

  { id: "assessment-email", prompts: ["what should i email", "what do i send", "how do i describe the problem", "brief for assessment"], answer: "A short description of the workflow you want automated or connected is enough to start: people involved, systems involved, and the point where it fails. Sherlock favours evidence over polished slides.", route: "/explore/engagement" },
  { id: "assessment-result", prompts: ["what do i get from assessment", "assessment deliverable", "what is the output", "assessment outcome"], answer: "The assessment ends in a written plan: what to build, what it connects to, and what it costs to run. You can then decide whether to move to Build.", route: "/explore/engagement" },
  { id: "scope-change", prompts: ["change the scope", "what if requirements change", "new requirements", "scope creep"], answer: "Build is fixed against the agreed assessment plan. If the facts change, the scope is made explicit before the work changes with it. A small but civilised practice.", route: "/explore/engagement" },
  { id: "maintenance-boundary", prompts: ["what does maintenance include", "maintenance scope", "support scope", "retainer covers"], answer: "Retain covers fixes and small changes as the system evolves. It is not a disguised route to unrelated new features; those deserve their own assessment.", route: "/explore/engagement" },
  { id: "documentation", prompts: ["documentation", "will it be documented", "technical docs", "how do we run it"], answer: "Documentation is handed over with code and configuration at delivery. The goal is an operable system, not a private ritual known only to its builder.", route: "/explore/engagement" },
  { id: "handover", prompts: ["handover", "after handover", "can we run it ourselves", "take over the system"], answer: "Yes. The agreed delivery is deployed into your environment and handed over with its configuration and documentation. Retain is optional continuity, not a lock-in device.", route: "/explore/constraints" },
  { id: "confidentiality", prompts: ["confidential", "nda", "secret project", "can you keep a secret", "discretion"], answer: "Client details and internal builds stay under discretion unless the client chooses otherwise. Sherlock is unusually fond of cases that remain properly closed.", route: "/explore/constraints" },
  { id: "client-names", prompts: ["who are your clients", "client list", "can i see clients", "past clients"], answer: "Some work is public and shown as selected projects; other builds are internal or covered by discretion. Absence from a portfolio is not absence of a system.", route: "/explore/projects" },
  { id: "proof", prompts: ["how do i know", "proof it works", "evidence", "results", "demonstrate value"], answer: "Each project is framed around the operating problem, the boundary, and the implementation evidence.

  { id: "gdpr-detail", prompts: ["gdpr compliant", "data residency", "eu data", "where does personal data go"], answer: "Data residency, access controls, and handling are agreed before implementation. EU regions are available where the requirement calls for them.", route: "/explore/constraints" },
  { id: "compliance", prompts: ["compliance", "regulated industry", "legal requirements", "auditability"], answer: "Compliance belongs in the operating design: clear boundaries, access controls, audit trails where required, and deterministic decisions where a person is materially affected.", route: "/explore/constraints" },
  { id: "production", prompts: ["production", "go live", "launch safely", "deploy to production"], answer: "Deployment goes into the agreed environment under the agreed access controls. For Anviq Agents, first go-live and production-reaching actions require human approval.", route: "/explore/approach" },
  { id: "downtime", prompts: ["downtime", "outage", "if it breaks", "system failure", "incident"], answer: "The relevant recovery and access expectations are part of the system's operating requirements. A good design asks how it fails before pretending it cannot.", route: "/explore/constraints" },
  { id: "migration", prompts: ["migration", "move our data", "replace old system", "legacy system"], answer: "A migration starts with the real records, integrations, owners, and risks—not with a promise to make the old system vanish by Friday.

  { id: "testing-detail", prompts: ["how do you test", "test before launch", "quality assurance", "qa"], answer: "The build is tested against the real systems and real workflow it must support, then verified in the agreed environment. A demo path alone is not enough evidence.", route: "/explore/approach" },
  { id: "api", prompts: ["api", "api integration", "connect api", "webhook", "third party service"], answer: "APIs and webhooks are ordinary evidence paths in an integration: the useful question is which system owns the fact, who may act on it, and what happens when it fails.", route: "/explore/services" },
  { id: "crm", prompts: ["crm integration", "connect our crm", "salesforce", "hubspot", "pipedrive"], answer: "A CRM is one of the systems Anviq can connect to the workflow around it. The assessment establishes the specific records, permissions, and handoffs before implementation.", route: "/explore/services" },
  { id: "scheduling", prompts: ["scheduling", "calendar integration", "appointments", "bookings"], answer: "Scheduling-to-billing and similar handoffs are exactly the kind of integration work considered here: trace the real workflow first, then make the transfer reliable.", route: "/explore/services" },
  { id: "billing", prompts: ["billing", "invoices", "accounting integration", "payments"], answer: "Billing systems can be connected where the workflow calls for it. The boundary is agreed carefully: moving an invoice is one thing; moving money is another case entirely.", route: "/explore/services" },
  { id: "spreadsheet-help", prompts: ["excel", "spreadsheet", "google sheets", "manual csv", "copy paste"], answer: "Spreadsheets are often useful evidence and sometimes an overworked production system.

  hello: "Good to see you. I have arranged the facts by usefulness, which is more than can be said for most inboxes.",
  name: "Sherlock, at your service. The hat was rejected on accessibility grounds.",
  "how-are-you": "Alert, concise, and entirely free of the need for coffee.",
  "who-are-you": "I am the site guide: part index, part concierge, and strictly less mysterious than I sound.",
  real: "Real enough to point you to the right page; not real enough to take a lunch break.",
  capabilities: "Ask about a project, a practical constraint, working together, or where the money goes. Those are my strongest chapters.",
  anviq: "Anviq builds and operates systems that solve an actual workflow problem, with one engineer accountable from first question to handover.",
  services: "The work begins with the system already in use, then makes its workflow clearer, safer, and less dependent on heroic manual effort.",
  fit: "Bring the awkward process, the handoffs, and the recurring pain. Those are considerably more useful than a feature wish list.",
  "how-work": "No theatre: inspect the real workflow, agree the boundary, build against reality, then hand it over or retain continuity.",
  price: "There is no rate card masquerading as certainty. Scope first; price follows the work that demonstrably needs doing.",
  assessment: "Think of assessment as the point where a hunch becomes a plan with owners, systems, costs, and a sensible next decision.",
  "fixed-price": "A fixed price follows a fixed understanding. Both are more comfortable than discovering scope by invoice.",
  retainer: "Retain is for evolution, fixes, and continuity—not an all-you-can-eat buffet for unrelated ambitions.",
  timeline: "The shortest honest answer is: once the workflow, access, and boundary are known. Then a date has evidence behind it.",
  availability: "A short conversation is enough to establish whether the case belongs here. If it does, the assessment is the next step.",
  contact: "The calendar is for a call; the email is for a written brief. Either route reaches the person who can act on it.",
  location: "Remote by default, deliberate about access and hosting. The system's requirements decide the arrangement.",
  "who-does-work": "There is no account handoff after the sale. The engineer remains the engineer.",
  technology: "Technology is a means of operating a system, not a personality test. The choice follows the constraints.",
  ai: "AI belongs where it makes work materially better and can be bounded. Elsewhere, a plain rule is often the smarter machine.",
  privacy: "Data handling is designed before launch: what is collected, who can reach it, where it lives, and what evidence remains.",
  security: "The useful security answer is specific: identity, access, isolation, recovery, and a record of what happened.",
  ownership: "Delivery should leave the client with usable code, configuration, and documentation—not a dependency disguised as a service.",
  hosting: "Cloud, EU region, client hardware, or an air-gapped machine: the location is selected by the risk and operating need.",
  support: "A system changes because the business changes. Retain is the route for keeping that evolution coherent.",
  projects: "Selected work is the case file: Anviq Agents, Steadyward, LV Matching, Addreach, and the Automated Recruitment CRM. Pick a case and inspect the evidence behind it.",
  agents: "The agents are software the business owns and runs, with private machines for risky work—not a chat window asking for trust.",
  "agents-safety": "No autonomous production leap: people approve consequential actions, and code executes in isolation.",
  steadyward: "Steadyward watches patterns and alerts people; it does not trade, move money, or pretend a warning is an order.",
  "lv-matching": "LV Matching turns repetitive quantity matching into a traceable, tenant-separated workflow with confidence visible at the line.",
  addreach: "Addreach treats deliverability and compliance as engineering constraints, because they are.",
  "recruitment-crm": "The recruitment system keeps legally significant matching deterministic and separates sensitive records by database role.",
  deterministic: "When an automated decision affects a person, explainable rules are a feature. The law is not impressed by cleverness alone.",
  integrations: "Good integration removes re-keying and ambiguity while leaving the responsible person able to see what happened.",
  automation: "The aim is not to automate for applause; it is to remove the brittle part while preserving judgement where it matters.",
  infrastructure: "A shipped system includes its environment, access, deployment path, and operating notes—not merely a repository.",
  quality: "Quality is verified against the workflow it must survive, including the awkward states that demos politely omit.",
  start: "Bring a real example of the process. The assessment turns it into an evidence-led plan rather than a hopeful brief.",
  github: "GitHub is the public evidence trail. It is not the whole work, but it is a useful place to inspect how things move.",
  cookies: "Policies are visible, and Sherlock does not build a secret visitor dossier. A rare and peaceful arrangement.",
  cv: "For employment, this is the wrong doorway. For an operational software problem, it is exactly the right one.",
  competitors: "Anviq is most useful when continuity, ownership, and operational constraints matter more than a large delivery cast.",
  "small-business": "A small team with a real recurring process can be a better fit than a large firm with no clear problem.",
  languages: "German or English is fine. Precise requirements are the preferred dialect.",
  memory: "I retain no personal dossier. A question should be able to stand on its own evidence.",
  conversation: "By all means. Begin with the thing that wastes time, creates risk, or relies on one person remembering everything.",
  thanks: "You are welcome. The facts remain available whenever the next question arrives.",
  goodbye: "Case paused, not closed. The magnifying glass remains on duty.",
  joke: "Why did the workflow cross the road? Because nobody had documented the handoff.",
  watson: "Watson handles the human warmth. I handle the pagination.",
  weather: "I can offer a forecast: unchecked assumptions, followed by a chance of rework.",
  chess: "My opening is always the same: identify the board before moving a piece.",
  advice: "Name the failure, the owner, and the consequence. That is usually enough to reveal whether software is the right remedy.",
  facts: "Smart enough to state the boundary; not vain enough to confuse that with omniscience.",
  help: "Useful prompts include: what does Anviq do, how does pricing work, which project fits this problem, and how do we start?",
  compliment: "A pleasing observation. I shall place it in the evidence locker and remain professionally restrained.",
  insult: "An excellent control test. Try a question about the work and see whether the hypothesis survives.",
  "off-topic": "My jurisdiction is limited, which has spared everyone several dubious restaurant recommendations.",
  fallback: "I have not found that in the case file. Try Anviq, services, pricing, a project, privacy, or contact.",
